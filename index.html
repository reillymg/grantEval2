	<p><a href="https://chapelhillpubliclibrary.org/" target="_blank"><span class="label">The Chapel Hill Public Library</span></a> website is a very community focused site with features encouraging engagement and key links highlighted on the home page. As with many library sites, CHPL features a prominent search bar where users can either search the catalog or the site itself. Options to get a library card and browse available eBooks and eAudiobooks are displayed below the search bar, prompting users to further engage with elements of the library. Important updates and the opportunity to subscribe to the newsletter are available on the homepage, as well as library hours and the ability to contact through email, phone, or social media. Patrons are able to request a group to come visit the library for special programs or request that library services visit them, such as story times or book talks at schools. The purpose of this site is facilitated by two things: community and outreach. </p> <!--closing the p tag -->

		<p>The site highlights many activities hosted by the library including but not limited to:
		<ul>
			<i>
				<li>Banned Books Week Community Read Aloud</li><!--Using the i tag to wrap a list is a bit overkill. If the lists should be italicized stylistically, that it's better to use css to do it. More semanitically valid.-->
				<li>Trading Cards Exhibit Gallery</li>
				<li>Spanish Story Time</li>
				<li>Author Talk + Book Signing with a local bookstore</li>
			</i>
		</ul>
		<p>A great feature of the site is its interactive events calendar, which can be viewed as a list of upcoming events, a chart with events displayed by the hour, or a slideshow of featured events. Users can also filter events based on age group, program type, registration type, or keyword.</p><!--Added paragraph tags because I felt like this is seporate content block form the above pagraph. Including line 14, as it reads to me like a single blcok of content.-->

		<p>Visiting the CHPL website makes visiting the physical library seem very enticing and comfortable. I know when going to a new place I am worried that I will do something wrong or not understand how something works, which makes going somewhere new anxiety-inducing and sometimes takes the option off the table entirely. The ease of reserving spaces and checking out equipment makes these features all the more enticing. Furthermore, if they do not have a title that you are looking for, you can request the library add it to the collection. They also offer a wide variety of courses available for free through the library for kids and adults, including:
			<ul>
				<i>
					<li>GED preparation</li>
					<li>Language resources</li>
					<li>Help on school subjects</li>
					<li>Citizenship test preparation</li>
					<li>Supplemental courses on things like: time management, healthy eating, etc.</li>
				</i><!--Moved this to be inclusive of what's wrapped. If a tag wraps another tag, the closing should be within the tag that's wrapping it, otherwise things can get kind of janky when the browser parses the html and style rules. See comment above about itallics. -->
			</ul>
		</p><!--Added paragraph tags because I felt like this is seporate content block form the above pagraph. Including line 14, as it reads to me like a single blcok of content.-->

<p>The usability and intuitive navigation of the site makes for a great user experience. The resources shown online are easily translated into the physical library space, creating an environment that allows users to explore the site and then feel prepared to enter the library knowing what to look for and how to interact with the space. However, if a patron is not able to make it into the actual library, the resources on the site and ability to directly download eBooks and eAudiobooks offers plenty of material to satisfy their needs.</p><!--Added paragraph tags here.-->
<br><!--Ok to put these here, but it would probably be better to use CSS to create the space you want to here.  -->
<br>
<!-- </p> Commenting out this code. Too much of a gap and weird inclusion here.-->

<br> <!-- 3rd break really makes me thing you should use CSS for this, we may not have covered it yet, or only just covered it, and this predates, but that's how you want to handle spacing between content that you might be using regularly.-->
