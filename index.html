<a href="https://chapelhillpubliclibrary.org/" target="_blank"><span class="label">The Chapel Hill Public Library</span></a> website is a very community focused site with
	features encouraging engagement and key links highlighted on the home page. As with many library sites, CHPL features a prominent search bar where users can either
		search the catalog or the site itself. Options to get a library card and browse available eBooks and eAudiobooks are displayed below the search bar, prompting users
			to further engage with elements of the library. Important updates and the opportunity to subscribe to the newsletter are available on the homepage, as well as library
				hours and the ability to contact through email, phone, or social media. Patrons are able to request a group to come visit the library for special programs or request
					 that library services visit them, such as story times or book talks at schools. The purpose of this site is facilitated by two things: community and outreach.
<div>
	The site highlights many activities hosted by the library including but not limited to:
<ul> <i>
<li>Banned Books Week Community Read Aloud</li>
<li>Trading Cards Exhibit Gallery</li>
<li>Spanish Story Time</li>
<li>Author Talk + Book Signing with a local bookstore</li>
</ul> </i>
A great feature of the site is its interactive events calendar, which can be viewed as a list of upcoming events, a chart with events displayed by the hour, or a slideshow of featured events. Users can also filter events based on age group, program type, registration type, or keyword.


Visiting the CHPL website makes visiting the physical library seem very enticing and comfortable. I know when going to a new place I am worried that I will do something wrong or not understand how something works, which makes going somewhere new anxiety-inducing and sometimes takes the option off the table entirely. The ease of reserving spaces and checking out equipment makes these features all the more enticing. Furthermore, if they do not have a title that you are looking for, you can request the library add it to the collection. They also offer a wide variety of courses available for free through the library for kids and adults, including:
<ul> <i>
<li>GED preparation</li>
<li>Language resources</li>
<li>Help on school subjects</li>
<li>Citizenship test preparation</li>
<li>Supplemental courses on things like: time management, healthy eating, etc.</li>
</ul> </i>

The usability and intuitive navigation of the site makes for a great user experience. The resources shown online are easily translated into the physical library space, creating an environment that allows users to explore the site and then feel prepared to enter the library knowing what to look for and how to interact with the space. However, if a patron is not able to make it into the actual library, the resources on the site and ability to directly download eBooks and eAudiobooks offers plenty of material to satisfy their needs.
